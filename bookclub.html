        <p>Welcome to the Anti-Racist Book Club of Chicago! Together we will work to educate ourselves so that we 
            can strengthen our understanding and be better allies for Black lives.
        </p>
        <p>We will focus on books about the Black experience in America as written by Black authors. This will be supplemented
            by suggested articles and essays and recommended films, music, and other art.
            Here you will find our anticipated reading list as well suggestions of
            Black-owned bookshops where you can purchase those titles.
