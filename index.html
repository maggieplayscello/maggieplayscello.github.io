            <p>Hello! I'm Maggie. I'm a cellist with over 15 years of professional orchestral and chamber experience. I'm an orchestra 
                librarian who has worked for regional orchestras and major festivals. I'm an educator who has taught in public schools 
                and been a teaching assistant at a major state university. And now, I'm bringing my curiosity, enthusiasm, and excitement
                for learning new skills to software development and website design.
            </p>
            <p>I recently graduated from Tech Elevator, a coding bootcamp in Detroit that teaches full-stack development based in Java. 
                I have found so many transferable skills from the other aspects of my career: the patience, precision, and eye for detail 
                of a musician; the project management, organization, and commitment to good design needed for librarianship; the communication
                skills, love of collaboration, and zest for learning required to be a quality educator. I'm excited by how much I've learned
                in such a short time and thrilled by how vast the opportunities are in technology.
            </p>

        <div id="hp2">
           <p>I believe firmly in accessibility and equity in education, and I plan to make it a major part of my career. I am confident 
                that technology can be used to further these aims. My time working at the front desks of public libraries gave me a front-row 
                seat to successes and failures of technology, and how already vulnerable populations are rarely adequately served.
            </p>
            <p>I'm also an avid hiker, a rabid Kentucky basketball fan, constantly reading at least three books at once, and completely obsessed 
                with my adopted dog, Francis.
