                <p>Hello! I'm Maggie. I'm a cellist with over 15 years of professional orchestral and chamber experience. I'm an orchestra 
                    librarian who has worked for regional orchestras and major festivals. I'm an educator who has taught in public schools 
                    and been a teaching assistant at a major state university. And now, I'm bringing my curiosity, enthusiasm, and excitement
                    for learning new skills to software development and website design.
                </p>
                <p>As a trained classical musician, I understand the value of every detail. A professional cellist for over fourteen years, my 
                    curiosity eventually lead me backstage into management. As an orchestra librarian, I was responsible for the researching, ordering, 
                    preparing, and distributing music for ensembles and music festivals, often while still performing as a member of the orchestra. I 
                    sincerely enjoyed the editing and formatting required to make each piece of music accurate, aesthetically pleasing, and optimally 
                    functional for each musician’s needs. It enhanced my organization and communication skills as I managed complex projects, usually 
                    remotely, within strict timelines.</p>

                    <p id="caption">As an elementary school student in computer class.</p>
                </div>
                <p>I also have a background in public libraries. Helping patrons to learn and utilize online resources and apps taught me to appreciate 
                    good design in software and websites. It gave me a passion for the many ways that easily accessible and widely available technology 
                    can spread knowledge and improve lives. My time working at the front desks of public libraries gave me a front-row 
                        seat to successes and failures of technology, and how already vulnerable populations are rarely adequately served.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    When I started to investigate software development, I realized that my skills and background would translate very well into this 
                    world. I love the challenge of improving efficiency with creative solutions and customizing my output to make my co-workers’s jobs 
                    easier and productive. I'd love to find a Junior Developer position with a company where I can continue to improve my skills while 
                    deploying my strengths. </p>
                <p>I'm also an avid hiker, a rabid Kentucky basketball fan, constantly reading at least three books at once, and completely obsessed 
                    with my adopted dog, Francis.
