        <p>Hello! I'm Maggie. I'm a cellist with over 15 years of professional orchestral and chamber experience. I'm an orchestra 
            librarian who has worked for regional orchestras and major festivals. I'm an educator who has taught in public schools 
            and been a teaching assistant at a major state university. And now, I'm bringing my curiosity, enthusiasm, and excitement
            for learning new skills to software development and website design.
        </p>
        <p>I recently graduated from Tech Elevator, a coding bootcamp in Detroit that teaches full-stack development based in Java. 
            I have found so many transferable skills from the other aspects of my career: the patience, precision, and eye for detail 
            of a musician; the project management, organization, and commitment to good design needed for librarianship; the communication
            skills, love of collaboration, and zest for learning required to be a quality educator. I'm excited by how much I've learned
            in such a short time and thrilled by how vast the opportunities are in technology.
        </p>
        <p>I believe firmly in accessibility and equity in education, and I plan to make it a major part of my career. I am confident 
            that technology can be used to further these aims. My time working at the front desks of public libraries gave me a front-row 
            seat to successes and failures of technology, and how already vulnerable populations are rarely adequately served.
        </p>
