                <p>Hello! I'm Maggie. I'm a professional cellist with over fifteen years of orchestral and chamber experience. I'm a librarian 
                    who has worked for public libraries and with regional orchestras and major music festivals. 
                    I'm an educator who has taught in public schools and been a teaching assistant at major institutions. And now, I'm bringing 
                    my curiosity, enthusiasm, and excitement for learning new skills to software development and website design.
                </p>
                <p>As someone who's innately curious, my life has centered itself around fields where there is always something new to learn 
                    and where I can surround myself with like-minded people. I fell in love with libraries at an early age and they've been a 
                    central part of my life for as long as I can remember. Almost immediately after I began playing the cello, I realized (with 
                    the help of my local library's surprisingly vast CD collection) that the world of classical music was seemingly bottomless. 
                    As I advanced through school and embarked on a professional performing career, I was kept engaged by its vast 
                    reservoir of literature, the constantly-changing repertoire each season, and the vibrant new music scene. However, my 
                    tendency to research and analyze every piece I was learning, along with an increasing fastidiousness about the parts I 
                    was using, resulted in an inevitable pull into the world of the orchestra library.
                </p>
                <p>As an orchestra librarian, I was responsible for the researching, ordering, preparing, and distributing music for ensembles 
                    and music festivals, often while still performing as a member of the orchestra. I sincerely enjoyed the editing and 
                    formatting required to make each piece of music accurate, aesthetically pleasing, and optimally functional for each 
                    musicianâ€™s needs. It enhanced my organization and communication skills as I managed complex projects, usually remotely, 
                    within strict timelines. Like performing, it allowed me to work with amazing musicians and in venues from Carnegie Hall to 
                    the mountains of Aspen, Colorado. 
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>I've been a lifetime patron of public libraries, but I've also worked for several. Helping patrons search the collection and 
                    teaching them how to utilize online resources was one of the most rewarding parts of the job; trading reading and 
                    media recommendations with coworkers and friendly patrons was another. The frequency with which we were called upon to help 
                    patrons how to use library-provided apps or programs made me appreciate good design in software and websites. It gave 
                    me a passion for the many ways that easily accessible and widely available knowledge, especially with the aid of technology, 
                    can improve lives in way large and small. My time working at the front desks of public libraries gave me a front-row 
                    seat to successes and failures of technology, and in many ways planted the desire that would eventually grow and lead me to 
                    attend a coding bootcamp.
                </p>
                <p>When I started to investigate software development, I realized that my skills and background would translate very well into 
                    this world. As a trained classical musician, I understand the value of every detail -- both in terms of accuracy and 
                    aesthetics. I love the challenge of improving efficiency with creative solutions and customizing my output to make the jobs 
                    and lives of others easier and more productive. I'd love to find a Junior Developer position with a company where I can 
                    continue to improve my newly-acquired coding abilities while deploying skills and strengths I've honed in my other careers.
