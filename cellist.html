        <h1>Cellist</h1>

                <p>I was fortunate to grow up around music: I sang in choirs and had piano lessons from an early age, though I did not 
                    find my true voice until she began cello lessons at age 12. I quickly blossomed as a cellist, enrolling in the Interlochen
                    Arts Academy as a sophomore and, upon graduation, began my undergraduate studies at the Eastman School of Music as a student
                    of Alan Harris. However, like many young musicians, I incurred a repetitive motion injury which became an increasing burden
                    on my career path. With Professor Harris's advisement, I transferred to the studio of Benjamin Karp at the University of
                    Kentucky to be closer to home in hopes that less stress would help me heal. However, the injury worsened and midway through
                    my undergraduate degree I took time off to have bilateral surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. During this time, I 
                    developed side careers as an orchestra librarian and private cello teacher while recuperating; as soon as I was physically
                    able, I began freelancing with nearby orchestras and eventually re-enrolled to complete my undergraduate degree at Grand 
                    Valley State University, then my master's degree at Florida State University with Gregory Sauer.
                </p>
                <p>I attended the Brevard Music Festival four times: once as a Teaching Assistant and every time on a full scholarship. 
                    I also attended the National Music Festival in Virginia.

                <p>Having completed my master's degree, I have performed as a freelance musician across the country. I have been a member of
                    professional ensembles in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. I have been a member 
                    of many of these orchestras and have achieved leadership roles with many including Acting Principal Cello with the Albany 
                    Symphony Orchestra in Georgia and the Sinfonia Gulf Coast in Florida. While functioning primarily as the Orchestra Librarian 
                    for the Spoleto Festival USA, I have been fortunate enough to participate in the annual gala concert as a member of the 
                    orchestra: part of the 2019 gala concert was aired on Performance Today and can be heard
