                <p>I was fortunate to grow up around music: from an early age, I sang in choirs and had piano and violin lessons. I was even a 
                    member of the National Youth Choir and performed in Carnegie Hall for the first time at age 11. However, it was not until 
                    I began cello lessons at age 12 that music became more than a hobby. After only two years of lesson, I was accepted to the 
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://academy.interlochen.org/"> Interlochen Arts Academy</a> 
                    and enrolled as a sophomore with a merit-based scholarship. After graduating, I began my undergraduate studies at the 
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.esm.rochester.edu/">Eastman School of Music</a> in Rochester, NY 
                    as a student of Alan Harris. However, like many young musicians, I incurred a repetitive motion injury which became an 
                    increasing strain n=on my development as a musician. Under Professor Harris's advisement, I transferred to the studio of 
                    Benjamin Karp at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://finearts.uky.edu/music"> University of
                    Kentucky</a> with hopes that a less stressful environment would help me heal. However, the injury worsened and midway through
                    my undergraduate degree I took time off to have bilateral surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. While recuperating, I 
                    developed my skills as an orchestra librarian and private cello teacher; as soon as I was physically able, I resumed 
                    freelancing with nearby orchestras and eventually re-enrolled to complete my undergraduate degree at 
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gvsu.edu/mtd/music-at-grand-valley-29.htm"> Grand 
                    Valley State University</a>, well known for their New Music Ensemble. I then completed my master's degree with Gregory Sauer 
                    at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://music.fsu.edu/">Florida State University</a>, where I was a 
                    Graduate Assistant.
                </p>
                <p>During my undergraduate years, I attended the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.brevardmusic.org/">
                    Brevard Music Festival</a> four times: once as a Teaching Assistant and every time on a full scholarship. 
                    I also attended the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nationalmusic.us/">National Music Festival</a> 
                    in Virginia. At both festivals, I sat principal at least once each season and participated in chamber ensembles.

                <p>Having completed my master's degree, I have performed as a freelance musician across the country. I have been a member of
                    professional ensembles in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. I have achieved 
                    leadership roles with many including Acting Principal Cello with both the Albany Symphony Orchestra in Georgia and  
                    Sinfonia Gulf Coast in Florida. While functioning primarily as the Orchestra Librarian for the Spoleto Festival USA, I have 
                    been fortunate enough to participate in the annual gala concert as a member of the orchestra: part of the 2019 gala concert 
                    was aired on the long-running public radio program Performance Today, and can be heard
