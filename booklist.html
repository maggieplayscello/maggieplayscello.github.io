            <p>"Oluo gives us—both white people and people of color—that language to engage in clear, constructive, and confident dialogue with each other 
                about how to deal with racial prejudices and biases."

            <p>“<em>How to Be Less Stupid About Race</em> takes no prisoners. Whether right, left, or center, all who are complicit with white racism face a withering 
                confrontation. For me, the spiritual heart of the book lies in the consecutive analyses of the Obama and Trump presidencies. Fleming demonstrates that 
                deep disdain for the latter need not mean nostalgia for the former.”

            <p>"Part lyrical narrative, part bluesy riff, part schoolyard chant and part holy incantation." <br>― New York Times<br>
                This hybrid artistic creation makes use of poetry, essays, and historical perspectives on race and desire to create a uniquely poignant
                work of art. This in turn inspired The Nashville Ballet to create a new work using Williams's poetry in collaboration with dance and music
                by other black woman artists. A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTrwega0BAs">Youtube video</a>
                about its creation is recommended viewing, and Williams's <a href="media.html#crw-article">powerful opinion piece in the New York Times</a> will 
                contribute to our conversation.
