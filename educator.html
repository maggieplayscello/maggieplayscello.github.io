                <p>Raised in a family of teachers, I first began teaching while still an undergraduate. Early teaching experiences included
                    teaching private lessons through the <a href="https://www.centralmusicacademy.org/">Central Music Academy</a> in Lexington, KY, a program which offers free lessons to young musicians
                    based on their eligibility for free and reduced-price lunches, and as a part of the after-school programs of Montgomery County Public
                    Schools in Mt. Sterling, KY. Later, I became a recurring substitute teacher in the Owensboro City and Daviess County Public Schools,
                    with a three-month stint at the latter where I taught 5th through 12th grade from the beginning of the school year through their
                    first concerts.

                <p>I have coached sectionals and chamber groups for the Owensboro Symphony Youth Orchestra in Kentucky, the Jacksonville Youth Orchestras
                    in Florida, and the National Youth Orchestra in New York.
                </p>
                <p>As a Teaching Assistant at the Brevard Music Festival in North Carolina, I taught supplemental lessons to all high school cellists 
                    and taught daily sectionals on their current orchestral repertoire while a student myself in the college division. At the conclusion 
                    of the program, I received the Best College Student Award, consisting of an invitation to return the following summer with a full
                    scholarship. This award was granted by a unanimous vote by the festival's faculty.
                </p>       
                <p>As a Graduate Assistant at Florida State University, I not only participated in orchestral, opera, and chamber performances as 
                    assigned, but taught several undergraduate non-majors, taught undergraduate music majors when faculty was out of town, and coached
                    chamber ensembles.
                </p>
                <p>As a member of the Giddens String Quartet, based in Florida, I performed educational outreach programs across the Florida panhandle.
