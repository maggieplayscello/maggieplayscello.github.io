            <p>My first experience as an Orchestra Librarian came when I was 16 and home for the summer from boarding school; the 
                librarian of my hometown orchestra, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://theoso.com/"> 
                Owensboro Symphony Orchestra</a>, in Kentucky, regularly brought in high school musicians to teach the basics of librarianship. 
                Five years later, during a break from school, the OSO was in need of an Assistant Orchestra Librarian, a position I took for 
                the season while continuing to play in the cello section. 
            </p>
            <p>Several years later, in 2013, coincidence arrived again as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
                href="http://www.sinfoniagulfcoast.org/"> Sinfonia Gulf Coast</a> of Destin, FL, needed a new librarian mid-season. 
                Already serving as Associate Principal Cello, I agreed to take on the additional responsibility and served in both positions 
                for the following two and a half years. SGC collaborates with a local ballet company to produce two fully staged ballets per 
                year, in addition to monthly performances of classical, pops, and educational programming.

            <p>Realizing how much I enjoyed library work, I applied for and was hired to be the head librarian for the <a target="_blank" 
                rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://spoletousa.org/"> Spoleto Festival USA </a>, a position I held for four years. The 
                Spoleto Festival is an annual arts festival in Charleston, SC, known for its adventurous programming and emphasis on new music;
                the festival brings extremely talented young musicians together into an ensemble that performs several large orchestral concerts, 
                multiple operas, and numerous chamber programs within a few short weeks. Before my third season, I initiated the creation of an 
                Assistant Librarian position, for which I screened resumes, conducted interviews, handled hiring, and oversaw the Assistant's hours 
                and duties throughout the festival. I also performed as a member of the orchestra for Spoleto's large-scale gala concerts. Part of 
                the 2019 gala concert, for which I prepared all music and also performed as a member of the cello section, was broadcast as part of 
                Performance Today and can be heard <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

            </p>
            <p>In 2017, I served as the Assistant Librarian for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
                href="https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Young-Musicians/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA"> National Youth Orchestra of the 
                United States</a>, a Carnegie Hall program. I assisted the head librarian with the main NYO ensemble and served as the head 
                librarian for NYO2, the younger ensemble. I toured with NYO2 to Philadelphia's Verizon Hall, where the orchestra performed a 
                concert in conjunction with the Philadelpha Orchestra, and with NYO to its performance on the Carnegie Hall stage. Together, the 
                head librarian and I oversaw and mentored an apprentice librarian.

            <p>In 2018, I was hired as the Orchestra Librarian for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
                href="https://www.southbendsymphony.org/"> South Bend Symphony</a> in Indiana, again taking the position mid-season due 
                to an unexpected situation. Although the SBSO is a part-time orchestra, it puts on an impressive 16 concerts each 
                season. Here, too, I regularly played in the cello section while preparing the ensemble's music.
            </p>
            <p>A member of the six-person library team for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
                href="http://www.aspenmusicfestival.com/"> Aspen Music Festival and School</a> in 2019, I was the librarian for the Aspen 
                Philharmonic Orchestra, served as librarian for a number of special concerts including the 4th of July band program, and assisted 
                the head librarian whenever requested. In this role, I oversaw and helped train AMFS students who were selected to work part-time 
                in the library.
            </p>
            <p>I have been a finalist or runner-up for full-time positions with major orchestras, including the Orlando Philharmonic, the Houston 
                Grand Opera, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Recently, I have worked part-time for the libraries of the Grand Rapids Symphony 
                and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. I am also available to take on digital engraving commissions for those who need arrangements, 
                transpositions, or transcriptions from hand-written or poorly engraved materials; you can contact me
