            <p>Maggie's first experience as an Orchestra Librarian came when she was 16 and home for the summer from boarding school; the 
                librarian of her hometown orchestra, the Owensboro Symphony Orchestra, in Kentucky, would bring in high school musicians and
                teach them the basics of librarianship. Five years later, during a break from school, the OSO found itself in need of an Assistant
                Orchestra Librarian, a position Maggie took for the season while continuing to play in the cello section. Her duties were primarily 
                marking parts and communicating with musicians, and included marking bowings, cuts, making a full new set for a production of Le 
                Nozze di Figaro, and maintenance of the collection and records. 
            </p>
            <p>Several years later, in 2013, coincidence arrived again as the Sinfonia Gulf Coast of Destin, FL, needed a new librarian mid-season. 
                Already serving as Associate Principal Cello, she served in both positions for the following two and a half years. SGC collaborates 
                with a local ballet company to produce two fully staged ballets per year, in addition to monthly programs of classical or pops.

        <div id="lp2">
            <p>Deciding that she truly enjoyed library work, she applied for and was hired to be the head librarian for the Spoleto Festival USA, 
                a position she held for four years. The Spoleto Festival is known for its adventurous programming, and Maggie gained signifigant
                experience with opera and contemporary repertoire as a result. Before her third season, she initiated the creation of an Assistant 
                Librarian position, for which she conducted interviews, handled hiring, and oversaw the Assistant's hours and duties throughout the 
                festival. She also performed as a member of the orchestra for Spoleto's large-scale gala concerts. Part of the 2019 gala concert,
                for which Maggie prepared all music and also performed as a member of the cello section, was broadcast as part of Performance Today and 
                can be heard <a href="https://www.yourclassical.org/programs/performance-today/episodes/2020/06/02">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>In 2017, she served as the Assistant Librarian for the National Youth Orchestra of the United States, a Carnegie Hall program.
                She assisted the head librarian with the main NYO ensemble and served as the head librarian for NYO2, the younger ensemble. She 
                toured with NYO2 to Philadelphia's Verizon Hall, where the orchestra performed a concert in conjunction with the Philadelpha 
                Orchestra, and the NYO to its performance on the Carnegie Hall stage.

        <div id="lp3">
            <p>In 2018, she was hired as the Orchestra Librarian for the South Bend Symphony in Indiana, again taking the position mid-season due 
                to the orchestra's unexpected situation. Although the SBSO is a part-time orchestra, it puts on an impressive 16 concerts each 
                season. Here, too, she frequently played in the cello section while preparing the ensemble's music.
            </p>
            <p>A member of the six-person library team for the Aspen Music Festival and School in 2019, she was the head librarian for the Aspen 
                Philharmonic Orchestra, served as librarian for a number of special concerts including the 4th of July band program, and assisted 
                the head librarian whenever requested. In this role, she oversaw and helped train AMFS students who were selected to work part-time 
                in the library.
            </p>
            <p>Maggie has been a finalist or runner-up for several full-time positions with major orchestras, including the Houston Grand Opera, 
                the Orlando Philharmonic, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.
