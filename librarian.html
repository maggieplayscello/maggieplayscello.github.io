    <h1>Librarian</h1>

            <p>My first experience as an Orchestra Librarian came when I was 16 and home for the summer from boarding school; the 
                librarian of my hometown orchestra, the Owensboro Symphony Orchestra, in Kentucky, regularly brought in high school musicians and
                taught them the basics of librarianship. Five years later, during a break from school, the OSO found itself in need of an Assistant
                Orchestra Librarian, a position I took for the season while continuing to play in the cello section. My duties were primarily 
                marking parts and communicating with musicians, and included marking bowings, cuts, making a full new set for a production of Le 
                Nozze di Figaro, as well as the usual maintenance of the collection and records keeping. 
            </p>
            <p>Several years later, in 2013, coincidence arrived again as the Sinfonia Gulf Coast of Destin, FL, needed a new librarian mid-season. 
                Already serving as Associate Principal Cello, I served in both positions for the following two and a half years. SGC collaborates 
                with a local ballet company to produce two fully staged ballets per year, in addition to monthly programs of classical or pops.

            <p>Deciding that I truly enjoyed library work, I applied for and was hired to be the head librarian for the Spoleto Festival USA, 
                a position I held for four years. The Spoleto Festival is known for its adventurous programming, and I gained significant
                experience with opera and contemporary repertoire as a result. Before my third season, I initiated the creation of an Assistant 
                Librarian position, for which I screened resumes, conducted interviews, handled hiring, and oversaw the Assistant's hours and 
                duties throughout the festival. I also performed as a member of the orchestra for Spoleto's large-scale gala concerts. Part of the 
                2019 gala concert, for which I prepared all music and also performed as a member of the cello section, was broadcast as part of 
                Performance Today and can be heard <a href="https://www.yourclassical.org/programs/performance-today/episodes/2020/06/02">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>In 2017, I served as the Assistant Librarian for the National Youth Orchestra of the United States, a Carnegie Hall program.
                I assisted the head librarian with the main NYO ensemble and served as the head librarian for NYO2, the younger ensemble. I 
                toured with NYO2 to Philadelphia's Verizon Hall, where the orchestra performed a concert in conjunction with the Philadelpha 
                Orchestra, and with NYO to its performance on the Carnegie Hall stage.

            <p>In 2018, I was hired as the Orchestra Librarian for the South Bend Symphony in Indiana, again taking the position mid-season due 
                to the orchestra's unexpected situation. Although the SBSO is a part-time orchestra, it puts on an impressive 16 concerts each 
                season. Here, too, I regularly` played in the cello section while preparing the ensemble's music. During this time, I have also
                worked as needed for the library of the Grand Rapids Symphony.
            </p>
            <p>A member of the six-person library team for the Aspen Music Festival and School in 2019, I was the head librarian for the Aspen 
                Philharmonic Orchestra, served as librarian for a number of special concerts including the 4th of July band program, and assisted 
                the head librarian whenever requested. In this role, I oversaw and helped train AMFS students who were selected to work part-time 
                in the library.
            </p>
            <p>I have been a finalist or runner-up for several full-time positions with major orchestras, including the Houston Grand Opera, 
                the Orlando Philharmonic, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Most recently, I have worked in a part-time capacity for the Detroit 
                Symphony Orchestra.

            <p>I will always maintain a passion for orchestra library work done well. I enjoy digital engraving and, having done an enormous amount 
                of transcription and arrangement, am very fluent at it and am available to take on projects on an individual basis.
